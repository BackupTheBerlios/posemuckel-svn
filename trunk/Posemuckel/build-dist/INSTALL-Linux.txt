1. Try this

Run the configure script in this directory:

./configure

It will figure out, if all applications needed
are installed and set some paths in a file called
"posemuckel" that is to be created. If this
succeeds, you can run the posemuckel client with

./posemuckel

in this directory or from any other directory on
your system. You can even move this file into your
path as long you do not move this directory you
unpacked from the tgz distribution.

2. If it does not work...
